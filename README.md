# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


<!-- make the page for Privacy Policy of a personalize recepie manager  name "MealMind",  use some react-icons and lucide-react to make it visually appleaing , use only React.js(vite) and Tailwind css .. -->

After some time I'll add the readme of it
